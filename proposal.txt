‚úÖ Project Proposal:
"Causal Factor Discovery in S&P 500 Returns using Double Machine Learning"
üéØ Objective
To estimate the causal effect of selected financial factors (e.g., volatility, momentum, trend) on the next-day return of S&P 500 stocks using Double Machine Learning (DML). We aim to go beyond correlation and build an interpretable, rigorous framework for understanding market dynamics from a causal lens.

üìå Problem Statement
Traditional models predict returns using statistical relationships, but these are prone to bias from confounders.
Goal: Use Double Machine Learning to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) of each factor on returns while controlling for confounders, offering a causally valid signal discovery framework.

üß† Theoretical Backbone
We follow the framework from Chernozhukov et al. (2018):

Step 1: Model the nuisance components (treatment and outcome regressions)

Step 2: Orthogonalize them to eliminate bias

Step 3: Estimate treatment effects using a meta-learner (linear or ML)

We‚Äôll use:

Treatment variable (T): A selected factor (e.g., volatility or momentum)

Outcome (Y): Next-day return

Controls (X): Other confounding financial indicators

üóÉÔ∏è Data Sources and Variables
‚úÖ Ticker Universe
S&P 500 constituents ‚Äî e.g., pick 1‚Äì5 stocks (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, JPM, XOM, AMZN) for today‚Äôs sprint

‚úÖ Features
Category	Variables Used
Return	Daily returns (used as target)
Volatility	Rolling standard deviation (5-day window)
Momentum	5-day cumulative return
Trend	Moving averages (5d, 10d, 20d)
Liquidity	Daily volume (log scaled)
Macro (if time)	VIX, FRED interest rates (optional)

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries
Purpose	Tool
Data	yfinance, pandas, numpy
ML Models	econml, sklearn, xgboost
Visualizations	matplotlib, seaborn, shap
Report/Logs	markdown, jupyter, .txt for logs

üß± Pipeline Overview
Step 1: Data Preparation
Pull OHLCV data for selected S&P 500 stocks (2019‚Äì2024)

Compute features:

Daily returns: (close_t - close_{t-1}) / close_{t-1}

5-day momentum: (close_t / close_{t-5}) - 1

5-day rolling volatility (stddev of returns)

Moving averages: 5d, 10d, 20d

Log(volume)

Drop NA rows due to rolling windows

Align X (features), T (treatment), and Y (target)

Step 2: Causal Modeling (DML)
We will model:

T = treatment variable = e.g., 5-day momentum

Y = outcome = next-day return

X = controls = e.g., volatility, moving averages, volume

We use:

python
Copy
Edit
from econml.dml import LinearDML
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV
Example setup:

python
Copy
Edit
model = LinearDML(
    model_y=RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100),
    model_t=LassoCV(),
    discrete_treatment=False,
    random_state=0
)
model.fit(Y, T, X=X)
Step 3: Evaluation & Analysis
Print ATE:

python
Copy
Edit
print("ATE:", model.ate(X))
Plot CATE vs. Feature:

python
Copy
Edit
cate = model.effect(X)
plt.scatter(X['volatility'], cate)
plt.title('Causal Effect of Momentum vs Volatility')
SHAP (optional) for model_y or model_t:

python
Copy
Edit
import shap
explainer = shap.Explainer(model.model_y)
shap_values = explainer(X)
shap.plots.beeswarm(shap_values)
üìä Outputs and Interpretation
ATE: One value per treatment ‚Üí tells you global causal effect

CATE plots: See how causal effect changes with confounders (X)

Discussion:

Does momentum cause positive returns when volatility is low?

Is the causal effect stable across different market conditions?
